# RUsafe

This repo is an iteration over https://devpost.com/software/ru-safe-xvenbz. I did not work on the original project.

Previously, the Java backend was run manually and the website was updated with locations of crimes. Now, it is an HTTP server and each time the website loads, it makes a request to this server to update crime locations.
